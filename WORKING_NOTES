	[built for x86_64 using the defconfig for x86_64-qemu plat.]

1)	RECOMPILATION OF LINUX SOURCES	

	after having in the directory output/images 
	ready for run our bzImage and rootfs, 
	we can alter the linux sources and recompile by 
	giving the command "make linux-rebuild"

2)      SSH FROM HOST TO GUEST QEMU

	Compile Buildroot again and enable, openssh from 
	Target Packages -> Network applications.
	
	Because Busybox permits the root to ssh, a creation of a new user
	takes place in the following step.
	Create a file called user_tables_ssh.txt and pass its
	path on make menuconfig at "System configuration" on
	() 'path to user tables'.
	Contents of the file creating a new user called foo, with password: bar.

	file "user_tables_ssh"
	foo -1 foo -1 =bar /home/foo /bin/sh - no_comment

	After that using hostforwarding
	(hostfwd=tcp::22222-:22) [parameter on qemu]
	ssh to the host using
	'ssh foo@localhost -p 22222' command.

3)	CROSS-COMPILE USER-SPACE PROGRAM AND SCP TO THE GUEST

	Under apps directory can be found an example of how to 
	create/cross-compile a sample userspace program and 
	copy it to the guest usng scp with host port forwarding.
	Program is cross compiled using the toolchain generated
	by Buildroot.

4)	CROSS-COMPILE LINUX KERNEL MODULES
